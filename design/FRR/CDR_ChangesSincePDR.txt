CDR: Changes Since PDR:
=======================

* Developed working prototypes of all mechanical systems, electrical systems, and software.  
	* mechanical:
		* horizontal, vertical carriages for the arm
		* gripper 
		* gripper linkage
		* horizontal movement of the arm
		* vertical movement of the arm
		* angular movement of the arm
		* angular movement of the wrist
		* actuation of the gripping mechanism
	* electrical:
		* communication circuitry for:
			* Jetson to XL-320 Servo
			* Jetson to MX-28T Servo
			* Jetson to Arduino
		* Driver circuitry for the high-power horizontal and vertical linear actuators
	* software:
		* image-based object detection; GPU accelerated
		* controls for:
			* linear actuators (height, radial)
			* wrist, gripper, and base servo motors
* Performed unit tests of all mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems.
* Performed integration tests for the AGSE system
